                    <p> The Siberian Husky dog breed has a beautiful, thick coat that comes in a multitude of colors and markings. Their blue or multi-colored eyes and striking facial masks only add to the appeal of this breed, which originated in Siberia.

                        It is easy to see why many are drawn to the Siberian’s wolf-like looks, but beware because this athletic, intelligent dog can act independently and challenge first-time dog parents. Huskies also put the “H” in Houdini and need a yard with a high fence that goes all the way into the ground to prevent escapes. Giving your Husky enough exercise may prove easier said than done; though, it’ll reduce boredom and unwanted behaviors, like escape attempts.</p>
